<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Born and raised in southcentral Indiana, I have grown to love the different seasons and everything that comes with them. For the past nine years, I have worked as a registered nurse. While I love being a nurse, I feel it is time to break into something new and challenging. I am currently taking a web development boot camp at Dimension Mill. During my free time, I am doubling up my learning by taking a class through Udemy. I would love the opportunity to work with you on your projects!</p>
